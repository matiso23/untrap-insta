# Privacy Policy for Untrap Insta

**Last Updated: December 5, 2025**

The "Untrap Insta" browser extension ("the Extension") is designed to modify the visual appearance of the Instagram website by hiding specific elements (Reels and Explore buttons) based on user preference.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data.**

* **No Tracking:** The Extension does not track your browsing history or usage of Instagram.
* **No Analytics:** The Extension does not use any third-party analytics scripts (e.g., Google Analytics).
* **No Remote Servers:** The Extension runs entirely locally on your device. No data is sent to any external server.

## Data Storage

The Extension uses your browser's local storage API (`storage.sync`) solely to save your configuration settings (e.g., whether "Hide Reels" is currently turned ON or OFF). These settings are synced between your own browser instances if you are signed into your browser account, but they are not accessible to the developer.

## Contact

If you have questions about this policy, please contact the developer via the support link on the Chrome Web Store or the GitHub repository.
