# Untrap Insta

A lightweight Browser extension that instantly hides Instagram’s Reels and Explore sections for a cleaner, distraction‑free feed.

You can toggle each switch separately in the settings, and the extension works on both Chrome and Firefox.


## Installation

2. Click **Add to Chrome** → **Add extension**.
3. The extension icon appears next to the address bar.

### Firefox Add‑ons
1. Visit the Firefox Add‑ons page for **Clean Insta UI**.
2. Click **Add to Firefox** → **Add**.
3. The icon appears in the toolbar.

## Usage

---  

1. Click the **InstaUntrap** icon to open the popup.
2. Use the switches to hide or show:
    - **Hide Reels** – removes the Reels tab and its icon.
    - **Hide Explore** – removes the Explore tab and its icon.
3. Changes are saved automatically and applied instantly to the current Instagram tab.
4. Settings sync across all browsers where you are signed in with the same Google/Firefox account.



## Privacy

---  

The extension does **not** collect, transmit, or store any personal data. All settings are kept locally (or synced via the browser’s built‑in sync service) and are never sent to external servers.
